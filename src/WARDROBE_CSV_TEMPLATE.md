## Tips

1. **Column Names**: The system is flexible with column names. For example, "Name", "Item", or "Product" will all work for the item name.

2. **Price Format**: You can include currency symbols (e.g., "$245" or "245"), but only the numbers will be used.

3. **Categories**: Common categories include:
   - Tops
   - Bottoms
   - Outerwear
   - Dresses
   - Shoes
   - Accessories
   - Bags
   - Jewelry

4. **Images**: If you don't have image URLs, leave this column empty or omit it. The system will use a default fashion image.

5. **Date Format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-10-04) for best results.

6. **Quotes**: If any field contains commas, wrap it in double quotes:
   ```csv
   "Silk Slip Dress, Midi Length",Reformation,Dresses,218,Sage Green,S,2025-07-10
   ```
